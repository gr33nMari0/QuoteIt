# QuoteIt
## What is QuoteIt!?
QuoteIt! is a super simple webapp I made that lets anyone record and store all of the quotes from the people around them!

To write new quotes, simply click on the "New Quote" Button up the top right and fill out the boxes! It's as simple as that!

## Features
QuoteIt! has a few little tricks up its' sleeve... such as organising your quotes with dates, tags, and authors!

And the best part: you can search for a quote by its' tags or authors, so you'll never lose a quote ever again :)

## The Goal
This project was designed with one goal in mind: to give anyone an clean and simple place to write down quotes from the people in their lives.

Quotes are one of the best ways that people remember significant (and insigificant) event in their lives... be it happy, sad, funny, all quotes are welcome here!

## The Development Process
This project was built using NodeJS with the ExpressJS Framework, EJS Templating, HTML and CSS, as well as front-end JavaScript for extra livelihood. On the server side, MongoDB and the Mongoose NodeJS Library were chosen as they are modern, light databases which work well with JavaScript's object notation.

In creating this project, I have begun to tinker with a few key NodeJS concepts, and I am finally learning proper MEN stack Website Development!
